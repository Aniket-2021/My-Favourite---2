            <p>My hobby is reading books. I love all types of books no matter, whether they're fictional, scary or on knowledgeable topics. I constantly keep asking my parents to buy me books. My parents keep telling me to- "read slowly", but I never do.<br><br>During the lockdown I was nearly bored to death due to the fact that I had no new books. The only thing that kept me from going insane were computer games, but even they became boring after some time. Books also help us stay disciplined, loyal, punctual and become a successful person in life . So, as you noticed,<br><br> I AM A BOOKWORM.</p>
